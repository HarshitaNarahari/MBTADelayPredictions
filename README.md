# MBTADelayPredictions
This repository contains my DS3000 Foundations of Data Science final project which predicts the delays on the MBTA based on the occupancy status using Python as the developing language.

The goal of our project was to determine whether there was a relationship between the stopping
sequences and the amount of time a train has been delayed in the Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority (MBTA). To determine this relationship, we decided to use a linear
regression model to deduce whether a certain stopping sequence would accurately predict the
amount of time a train has been delayed. When we refer to the stopping sequence, we are talking
about how long a train has been stationary at a given MBTA station. The delay time we will be
referring to is the amount of time, in minutes, that a train has been delayed compared to the
original schedule. However, we ran into challenges regarding our data and using a linear
regression model, so we shifted our focus to analyzing the occupancy status of trains where
occupancy status is the number of seats available on a given train.
