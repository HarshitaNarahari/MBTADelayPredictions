# MBTADelayPredictions
The goal of our project was to determine whether there was a relationship between the stopping
sequences and the amount of time a train has been delayed in the Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority (MBTA). To determine this relationship, we decided to use a linear
regression model to deduce whether a certain stopping sequence would accurately predict the
amount of time a train has been delayed. When we refer to the stopping sequence, we are talking
about how long a train has been stationary at a given MBTA station. The delay time we will be
referring to is the amount of time, in minutes, that a train has been delayed compared to the
original schedule. However, we ran into challenges regarding our data and using a linear
regression model, so we shifted our focus to analyzing the occupancy status of trains where
occupancy status is the number of seats available on a given train.

As college students ourselves, we were inspired to use data from the MBTA because
we have all experienced the various problems associated with the MBTA. For example, trains are
never following the schedule displayed online and certain routes or lines are often at the last
minute. As a result, oftentimes people are stuck waiting up to thirty minutes for a train because
they missed the previous one because it was too early, or the train is running late. We believed
that by analyzing MBTA data with machine learning models we learned in class we would be
able to answers questions about whether there are certain features that cause a train route to be
more popular than others or whether there are trends or patterns in the trains that are constantly
delayed.
